# **Marvel**
Marvel is a plugin initially used the Clover Network that dynamically loads 
"patches" from a directory in the machine. 
This was used multiple times to fix simple bugs that would ruin some aspect of the server
however, recently I decided to make this public. 

**USAGE**
- Upload this plugin on your server.
- Create some sort of patch using the in-house api
- Upload the patch to this plugin's `configuration directory`
- Finally, use the command `/marvel load <patch jar name>` to load the patch.
